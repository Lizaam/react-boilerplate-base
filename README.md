# React Boilerplate Basic

This is a base react boilerplate template to minimize my setup time when i start building front end application.

Note: Node v6+ is required for this boilerplate, boilerplate is also still in development as more standard dev dependancies will be added as time goes on.

To begin, use `npm install` to install all dev dependancies.

To clone respository, run following command 

`git clone https://github.com/Lizaam/react-boilerplate-base.git <br /> cd react-boilerplate-base
`

To run development environment, run following command

`npm start`

To build for production, run following command

`npm build`
